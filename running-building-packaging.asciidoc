== Running, building and packaging.

=== Running the first time
After downloading and extracting the zip package, it is recommended to run the software once and see that it is working.

You can start up the project, for the first time and while developing, from the terminal with the help of Maven command `mvn spring-boot:run`. You can also use any IDE with Maven integration to run the `spring-boot:run` goal.

=== Building the package
To build the project, the standard `mvn install` command can be used. This will produce a deployable, self containing jar in the target package

=== Running integration tests
Integration tests are run with the `mvn verify -Pit` command.

UI tests can take a while to run, so the integration tests are in a separate `it` profile, to provide a little bit more flexibility.

=== Building and running on production mode

By default, building and running are made in 'development' mode. This is good while working on the app as the build/start time is shorter, but the app would not work in IE11.
In order to use production mode, you need to add `-Dvaadin.productionMode` to build/run commands:

build: `mvn clean install -Dvaadin.productionMode`
run: `mvn spring-boot:run -Dvaadin.productionMode`

=== Development vs production mode

The default mode when the application is built or started is 'development'. The 'production' mode is turned on by setting the `vaadin.productionMode` system property when building or starting the app.

In the 'production' mode all frontend resources of the application are passed through the `polymer build` command, which minifies them and outputs two versions: for ES5- and ES6-supporting browsers. That adds extra time to the build process, but reduces the total download size for clients and allows running the app in browsers that do not support ES6 (e.g. in Internet Explorer 11).
